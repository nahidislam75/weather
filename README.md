# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

npm run build

npm start
```

## Step 1: Create a Vite + React Project

```sh
npm create vite@latest my-vite-app --template react-ts
# or
yarn create vite@latest my-vite-app --template react-ts
cd my-vite-app
```

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

### Install Tailwind CSS

```sh
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer

You're all set! ðŸŽ‰

# Why React, Material-UI, Material-UI Icons, Tailwind CSS, and Axios?

In this project, I chose **React**, **Material-UI**, **Material-UI Icons**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Axios** for the following reasons:

- **React**: Itâ€™s fast, flexible, and perfect for building interactive UIs. Its component-based structure helps keep things organized and reusable.
- **Material-UI**: Provides a set of pre-built, customizable components based on Googleâ€™s Material Design, which makes creating a consistent, modern UI super easy. Itâ€™s also responsive and accessible.

- **Material-UI Icons**: It offers a large collection of easy-to-use icons that can be easily customized and styled, helping enhance the UI without needing to search for external resources.

- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that lets me style elements quickly using simple classes. Itâ€™s highly customizable, efficient, and great for building responsive designs without extra custom CSS.

- **Axios**: A lightweight and easy-to-use library for making HTTP requests. It simplifies the process of fetching data and handling responses, with built-in features like interceptors and error handling.

Together, these tools let me build fast, beautiful, and maintainable apps with a smooth development process.
